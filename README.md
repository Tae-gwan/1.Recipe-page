## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS grid

### What I learned
I learned how to apply fonts (@font-face).
I don't know 100% yet, but I knew margin,padding,max-width more.

### Continued development

I divided classes to apply styles in CSS, but I think there are quite a few inefficient parts.
So plz give me some tips!! Thank you!!
